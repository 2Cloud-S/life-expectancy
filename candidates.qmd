Candidates' lives are often affected by elections. Using data from the paper "Longevity Returns to Political Office" by Barfort, Klemmensen & Larsen (2019), which includes all candidates in U.S. gubernatorial elections after 1850 who were deceased as of 2012, we seek to create a model for forecasting longevity for political candidates.
