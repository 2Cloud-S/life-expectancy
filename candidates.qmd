Candidates' lives are often affected by elections. Using data from the paper "Longevity Returns to Political Office" by Barfort, Klemmensen & Larsen (2019), which includes all candidates in U.S. gubernatorial elections after 1945, we seek to create a model for forecasting longevity for political candidates. Because our data includes only candidates for governor, our estimated model might not generalize well to candidates for other political offices, such as mayor or city council. We model life expectancy after the election, measured in years lived after election day, as a linear function of a candidateâ€™s sex and age at the time of election. A 50-year-old male political candidate can expect to live about 30 years after the election, plus-or-minus about 1 year.




## Model Structure

We represent our statistical model as:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_k X_k + \varepsilon
$$


## Fitted Model

The estimated linear regression model is:

$$
\hat{lived\_after} = 58.3 + 0.15 \cdot sex_{Male} - 0.68 \cdot election\_age
$$


## Regression Model Estimates

```{r}
#| label: regression-table
#| cache: true

# Extract model estimates as a tibble with confidence intervals
fit_summary <- tidy(fit_years, conf.int = TRUE)

# Create a formatted regression table
fit_summary |>
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) |>
  gt() |>

  cols_label(
